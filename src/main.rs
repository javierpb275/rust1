/*
A reference is like a pointer in that itâ€™s an address we can follow to access data 
stored at that address that is owned by some other variable. Unlike a pointer, 
a reference is guaranteed to point to a valid value of a particular type. 

These ampersands represent references, and they allow you to refer to 
some value without taking ownership of it.
